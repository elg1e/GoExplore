# GoExplore

 GoExplore is a project created to allow users to discover and prepare for trips across the globe. 
GoExplore allows users to search for a destination then find bars, resturants, accommodation and cafes within that area. 
 
## UX

 The idea for this project was to create a website for users to be able to orginise their trips with one single search. 
The priority for this project was to ensure the site is as user friendly as possible. By simply typing a destination and pressing the search button the user can find out about accommodation, bars, cafes and resturants. 

User Stories:

- As a user I want to be able to search for a city so that I can find out more information about it.
- As a user I want to be able to press a button so that I can see the cafes/accommodation/bars/restaurants in the city I'd like to visit.
- As a user I want to be able to press a button to guide me through the steps so that I understand how to use the website.
- As a user I want to be able to click a link to a cafe/hotel/bar/restaurant so that I can find out more information about it.

## Features

### Google Map
 The main feature of this website is the [Google Maps API](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/). This allows the users to view anywhere around the world. This is how the user will be able to find a destination, use one of four filter buttons which will places markers on the map and allow the user to research the area before travelling. 

### Four Button Map Filters

### Help Box
 Another fuction added to the site is a help button. This help button can be pressed at anytime by the user if they do not understand how to use the site. When the help button is pressed a pop up box will appear. In this box is a step by step guide on how to use the site.
